Business Problem Statement: As Maverik has a business plan of opening 30 new stores every year, the projected performance of new stores is crucial to successful selection, opening, and continual operations of these new stores while also maintaining consistent operations and growth at existing locations. Stakeholders require a first-year revenue report; therefore, one part of our model will answer this question.

Solution: My team creatde a model that outperforms the current “naive” model that has been running for several weeks. The team will compare our model vs the naive model by looking at the absolute numbers, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). Additionally, it will forecast the daily sales of specific items such as gasoline, diesel, in-store merchandise, in-store food, and various other items. With accurate and precise predictions, Maverik will be able to create a more accurate financial plan and provide more useful initial ROI estimations. Our model will be compared against the actual sales figures. Per stakeholders, a successful model will quickly become accurate and precise if it starts out incorrect. How quickly can our model get daily predictions within a 5% range?

Business Value of Solution: The project's findings provide Maverik with a solid foundation for creating a forecasting model that can enhance store selection, optimize inventory management, and improve overall business operations. These insights, coupled with the proposed solutions, position Maverik for more informed and data-driven decision-making, ultimately contributing to its growth and success in the competitive gas station and convenience store industry. This will in turn, increase their return on investment.

Projects:

>Exploratory Data Analysis: relationship between target and predictors through use of visualizations and data cleaning.

>Modeling: use of benchmarks of RMSE, Mean Absolute Error, and MAPE in XGB Model and LTSM Model.

>Presentation: group documentation and outline of Maverik presentation with final notes

Difficulties: 
Learning Experience: Overall, this was a great learning experience because I got to experience really fine tuning a project from start to finish. I got to see the nuances that would prehibit further movement in a project and troublshoot on how to get out of the situation. This class allowed me to apply my analytical skills to business understandings, which will help with any future career endeavors
